    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to be dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophisticaiton</em>, the seemingly magical abilty to take commmand of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keybaord shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more.

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Quotations</h2>

    <p>
      In adddition to hosting most of the world's supply of the kitten videos, the Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one.

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the 
      <a href="https://railstutorials.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the 
      <a href="https://www.softcover.io">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
      This page is part of the sample site for 
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to be dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of
      <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at

    </p>

    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people probably more.

      Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorials.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of 
      <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step plan for the world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end developement, writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with capital cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his table.

  William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines long (three 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain">quatrains</a>
  followed by a rhyming 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki.Couplet">couplet</a>).
  <strong>Sonnet 18</strong> is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
  Shall I compare thee to a summmer's day?<br>
  Thou art more lovely and more temparate.<br>
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
  And summer's lease hath all to short a date.
</p>
